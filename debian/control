Description: A library for creating custom data acquisition systems.
 The end goal is something that allows you to create custom systems
 that can use either or both polling and asynchronous acquisitions.
 Data received can be logged using flat CSV files or a database (currently SQLite3 only).
 This is still a complete work in progress.
